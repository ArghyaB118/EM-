# Cache-adaptivity test
### We test three algorithms for Longest Common Subsequence problem
The algorithms we test are as follows.
- Classic DP algorithm (Classic)
- Hirschberg's algorithm (Hirschberg)
- Chowdhury and Ramachandran's cache-oblivious algorithm (Oblivious)

Bender et al. proved that Oblivious is cache adaptive.

### Implementations of Algorithms
All three algorithms are implemented by Rezaul A. Chowdhury

### Median
The algorithms and their implementations are given by Prof. Rezaul A. Chowdhury. To run the programs, run `make med`, then `./med -if inputs/seq_128.in`.
